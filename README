Hello Everyone, thank for looking at my repo's. 

I love programming and in order for me to sharpen my skills, I have created some programs so that I can practice and share my programs so that someone else can benefit from them and learn from them. All of these programs were created by me so no licensing is required. If by chance you use them and integrate them in a program that you intend to sell, no royalties are needed, but please give credit for the work I have done. You can add a comment line at the last line of the program and add #(or any comment symbol)lines x-y are from gyoshidome.

I am by all means not a genius or a programming master so there may be errors, however, I try to explain in my programs using comments to explain what the particular function does or why it is needed. Of course there are many different ways to approach a problem, and by no means am I advanced, so any comments by veterans and professionals would be greatly appreciated. 

I currently do not have any on going projects, however, I am learning how to use the android sdk and programming techniques to program apps for the android.

Anyways, thanks for looking!

Gin
